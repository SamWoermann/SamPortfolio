        <p>I made a procedural asteroid field generator in Godot 4.5!<br> But, how did I accomplish this?</p>
        <div class="container"><img src="images/asteroidfield1.png" width="100%"></div> An asteroid field!

        <h2>Step 1 - The asteroids</h2>
        <p>The first thing I did was following a <a href="https://youtu.be/hHRhDEVwDho?si=CTlZaPoxkpW7A3CU"><b>tutorial</b></a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ombarus">Ombarus</a> to make a procedural planet generator in Godot.</p>
        <p>It was pretty cool, I was able to generate planets with a bunch of different parameters to play with. I quickly realised that I could also generate asteroids quite easily!</p>
        <div class="container"><img src="images/planetgen1.png" width="100%"></div> One of the first planets I procedurally generated after I managed to get it working
        <h2>Step 2 - The asteroid field</h2>
        <p>I created an imaginary 3D grid, of which each position in the grid could be a potential asteroid location.</p>
        <p>To determine where asteroids would be placed, I used a value noise generator built-in to Godot. Each position in the 3D grid that was above a certain threshold then generated a unique, random asteroid that adhered to a pre-determined range of parameters.</p>

        A close-up of one of the asteroids in the asteroid field. Note that the resolution of the asteroid is reduced so that a larger field can be generated.
