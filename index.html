        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Kia ora! I'm Sam, and I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Game Development. I have been fascinated with software as long as I can remember. I'm driven by a passion to bring both software solutions and games to life. </p>
    <p>The principles I value most are kindness, equity and loyalty.</p>
    <p>I first developed a passion for Game Development in high school, where I made a 3D platformer game focused around a grappling gun with some of my friends in Unity. <br> A few years after this, I developed a simple multiplayer shooter in Godot, and I had the opportunity to have my class play it. I was amazed that I was able to develop the engaging experience my classmates were having.</p>
    <p>This led me to decide that I would add a minor in Game Development to my Computer Science degree. I've found that my programming skills and what I've learnt in Computer Science have complimented my ability to develop engaging, immersive game experiences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "skills" id="skills"><h2>Skills</h2><p>I am familiar with the Unity and Godot engines. I have developed a number of projects in both engines, some of which are showcased in the projects section below. <br> As for programming and markup languages, I have a good level of experience in Python / GD Script, C#, Java, as well as HTML & CSS.</p> <p>I am a very collaborative person, and work well in a team. I have experience in leading and organising a group project.</p>

    <div class = "projects" id="projects"><h2>Projects</h2> <h3>VR Escape Room</h3>
        <p>The first proper VR game that I ever made. This was a solo project - I developed it all by myself. I used Unity, and the Unity XR Toolkit to develop the game.</p>

    <p>Procedural generation lead me to a rabbit hole that resulted in me making a procedural asteroid field generator.</p>
